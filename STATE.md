# AiLys Agency — Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-04-27 (Phase 4 + Cofounders + DNS shipped; Tier 3 rebrand to Agency + add-ons in flight)
**Branch:** `main` · **Tag:** `v0.2.0` · **Active commit:** `cf0f360` (ailysagency, before rebrand) + `25a2491` (reviuzy)
**Production:** https://ailysagency.pages.dev (manual `wrangler pages deploy`; auto-deploy webhook broken since 2026-04-26).
**Custom domain (DNS done, redirect rule pending user manual step):** `ailysagency.ca` apex CNAME + www CNAME → ailysagency.pages.dev (proxied), Pages verification active. `ailysagency.com` AAAA placeholders for redirect rule. Redirect rule (`*ailysagency.com/* → https://ailysagency.ca/$1`, 301, preserve query) needs manual creation at https://dash.cloudflare.com/3b889a272b6925fa7cbc892a83999541/ailysagency.com/rules/redirect-rules.
**Pricing (rebrand in progress):** $300 (Starter) / $600 (Core) / $1,200 (Growth) / **$2,499 (Agency, was Autopilot at $1,599)** CAD per month, month-to-month, 30-day satisfaction guarantee.
**Add-ons (in flight, dispo on Starter / Core / Growth, bundled in Agency):**
  - **Reviuzy reputation system** at +$100/mo (NFC reviews, AI review gen, contest engine with video, AI auto-replies, T&C generator, fake review detection — client self-serve; agency delivers GBP/citations/NAP/AI Visibility/AI Traffic in background)
  - **Domain Shield** at +$35/mo individual
  - **Domain Speed Boost** at +$35/mo individual
  - **Dedicated strategist** at +$35/mo individual
  - **Premium Ops trio bundle** (Shield + Boost + Strategist) at $79/mo (saves $26 vs $105 individual)

## Open issues / next session

### Phase 2-4 SHIPPED (2026-04-27 session, all features built end-to-end in Reviuzy)

**Phase 2 — Reviuzy GBP gaps (B.1, B.2, B.3):**
- B.1 GBP photo upload: edge function `google-upload-photo` + admin `/gbp/photos` + help article. Migration `rate_limits` table.
- B.2 GBP Q&A bot: 3 edge functions (`google-fetch-questions`, `gbp-draft-reply` calling Claude Opus 4.7, `google-post-answer`) + admin `/gbp/questions` 4-tab queue + help article. Migration `gbp_question_drafts` table.
- B.3 GBP attributes: edge function `google-attributes` (fetch + update modes) + admin `/gbp/attributes` + help article.

**Phase 3 — Citation building + NAP (C.1, C.2, C.3):**
- C.1 Citation directory tracker: hand-curated catalog of 27 directories (`src/data/citationDirectories.ts`) + admin `/citations` 5-tab workflow + help article. Migration `citation_submissions` table.
- C.2 NAP consistency checker: admin `/nap` with canonical lock + diff detection + observation history + help article. Migration `nap_snapshots` table.
- C.3 Citation tracking dashboard: subsumed by CitationManager Verified tab + audit log.

**Phase 4 — AI visibility advanced (D.1, D.2, D.3, D.4):**
- D.1+D.2+D.3 AI Visibility engine: edge function `ai-visibility-run` probing 6 engines via Claude Opus 4.7 (thinking adaptive, effort high, prompt cache on system prompt) + admin `/ai-visibility` with Share of Model bar chart, sentiment per engine, competitor rollup, freshness alerts, named-competitor editor + help article. Migration `ai_visibility_runs`, `ai_competitors`, `ai_traffic_visits` tables.
- D.4 AI Traffic conversion tracker: public edge function `ai-traffic-ingest` (no auth, token-based, SHA-256 hashed at rest, IP-bucket rate limit, AI engine detection from utm_source AND referrer host across 10 patterns) + admin `/ai-traffic` with token generator, copy-paste snippet, conversion call template, per-engine breakdown + help article.

**Help articles in AiLys help center (EN + FR-CA, all per CLAUDE.md hard rule #10 — no proprietary disclosure):**
- `gbp-photo-uploads`, `gbp-qa-monitoring`, `gbp-attributes`, `citation-building`, `nap-consistency`, `ai-visibility-engine`, `ai-traffic-tracker`. 7 new articles, all bilingual.

**Reviuzy commits:** `5a411f8` (B.1), `8d3cc4c` (B.2), `408306a` (B.3), `871bede` (Phase 3), `25a2491` (Phase 4).
**ailysagency commits:** `496cbc1`, `6b2da40`, `3b5f181`, `2b8ae00`, `0d43a2d` (5 help-article commits).

**⚠️ Operator action items before features go live:**
1. Apply 3 new Reviuzy migrations via Supabase SQL Editor (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qucxhksrpqunlyjjvuae/sql/new):
   - `20260427100000_create_gbp_question_drafts.sql`
   - `20260427110000_create_citation_submissions.sql`
   - `20260427120000_create_ai_visibility_tables.sql` (also adds `tenants.ai_traffic_token_hash` column)
2. Deploy 7 new Reviuzy edge functions: `npx supabase functions deploy google-upload-photo google-fetch-questions gbp-draft-reply google-post-answer google-attributes ai-visibility-run ai-traffic-ingest --project-ref qucxhksrpqunlyjjvuae`
3. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Reviuzy Supabase function secrets (used by `gbp-draft-reply` and `ai-visibility-run`).

### Priority A (Phase 1 — DONE earlier this session)
- **Tier 3 Autopilot price** raised from $1,299 to $1,599 across 16 locales + code (114 + 32 = 146 substitutions).
- **GBP post cadence ladder** wired into tier features (1 / 4 / 8 / 12 per month).
- **2-3 net-new 2026 features per tier** added to the marketing surface: AEO content brief generator, GBP Q&A monitoring, Share of Model dashboard, brand sentiment + citation freshness alerts, AI traffic conversion tracker, dedicated success strategist + monthly executive briefing.
- **3 net-new i18n keys** (tier1Feat7, tier2Feat8, tier3Feat9), all 21 changed/new tier feature keys translated to 15 non-EN locales (315 strings).
- **CLAUDE.md hard rules 9-12** added: Government-grade security on every new feature, help center docs without proprietary disclosure, mandatory admin center surface, tests-must-pass-before-delivery.
- Audit clean: 16/16 locales at 100%, 0 em-dashes in translations, typecheck clean, build green.

### Priority B (Phases 2-4 — NEXT sessions, each one full feature with admin + help docs + tests + deploy)

**Phase 2 — Reviuzy GBP gaps (~3 days):**
- B.1 GBP photo upload automation (4-6 photos/mo for Autopilot). Reviuzy currently lacks this.
- B.2 GBP Q&A bot (auto-draft replies, human approval) — surfaced as a Core+ feature in marketing, not yet built in Reviuzy.
- B.3 GBP attribute / category management (currently sync-only).
- All three need: rate-limit, tenant-scoped audit log, admin panel toggle, EN+FR-CA help articles before going live.

**Phase 3 — Citation directory + NAP (~1 week):**
- C.1 Directory submission engine (Yelp, BBB, Yellow Pages, vertical directories) so the "5/10 citations per month" promise is real.
- C.2 NAP consistency checker scanning 20+ directories.
- C.3 Citation tracking dashboard (per directory, per month, per location).

**Phase 4 — AI visibility advanced (~2 weeks):**
- D.1 Share of Model dashboard (real backend behind the marketing claim) — tracks brand mention frequency per LLM vs 3 named competitors.
- D.2 Brand sentiment in LLM responses (positive/neutral/negative classification per citation).
- D.3 Citation freshness alerts (40-60% of cited sources change month to month — alert when AiLys client churns out).
- D.4 AI traffic conversion tracker (UTM-based attribution from AI search referrers to bookings, pluggable into client GA4/Plausible).

**Each phase MUST satisfy CLAUDE.md hard rules 9-12 before merging.**

### Priority C (configuration tasks for the user, not Claude)
Set in **Cloudflare Pages → ailysagency project → Settings → Environment variables**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — activates LLM citation matrix, hero citation strip, AI visibility score (currently shows samples)
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` — activates PlacesPreview + CompetitorOverlay
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — activates newsletter double-opt-in confirmation emails
- `VITE_GTM_ID`, `VITE_META_PIXEL_ID`, `VITE_LINKEDIN_PARTNER_ID` — analytics (after consent)

GitHub Actions secret (for the auto-deploy workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, currently staged but not committed):
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — Cloudflare Pages: Edit, scoped to the ailysagency project. The unified Workers & Pages dashboard removed the legacy "Git integration" management UI; reconnecting the GitHub webhook is no longer possible from the dashboard, so we restore auto-deploy via GitHub Actions instead.

### Priority B (deferred audit engine enhancements)
Documented in `docs/audit-engine-roadmap.md`:
- Phase B.4 PDF export (~10h, high value)
- Phase C.2 Continuous monitoring upsell (~12h, recurring revenue)
- Phase C.4 Anonymized peer benchmark (~6h)
- Phase D.6 Competitor content critique (~6h)
- Phase D.2 Audit-my-competitor tab (~8h, viral)
- Phase B.2 SSE streaming theater (~6h)
- Phase D.1, D.4, D.5, D.7, D.8 — voice mode, embeddable widget, resellers API, multiplayer audit, GSC OAuth

### Priority C (configuration tasks for the user, not Claude)
Set in **Cloudflare Pages → ailysagency project → Settings → Environment variables**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — activates LLM citation matrix, hero citation strip, AI visibility score (currently shows samples)
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` — activates PlacesPreview + CompetitorOverlay
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — activates newsletter double-opt-in confirmation emails
- `VITE_GTM_ID`, `VITE_META_PIXEL_ID`, `VITE_LINKEDIN_PARTNER_ID` — analytics (after consent)

KV namespace bindings recommended:
- `CITATION_CACHE`, `AI_VIS_CACHE`, `LLM_MATRIX_CACHE`, `PLACES_CACHE` (24h TTL each)

### Open known limitations
- Chat widget UI is translated, but backend uses Reviuzy's Supabase functions (chat answers may lean Reviuzy-flavored). Long-term path documented in LandingChatWidget.tsx header comment as `TODO(ailys-chat)`.
- **Cloudflare auto-deploy on push is broken since ~04-26** (GitHub webhook stopped firing after a stuck-loop redeploy of `e6d5c40`). Confirmed by deployment list showing 30+ commits skipped between `e6d5c40` and `11f6b16`. The unified Workers & Pages dashboard removed the Git integration management UI for migrated projects; reconnect via GitHub Actions workflow (staged at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, awaiting `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret).
- **Phase 1 marketing features ahead of build.** The new bullet points (Share of Model dashboard, AEO content brief generator, GBP Q&A monitoring, AI traffic conversion tracker, sentiment + citation freshness alerts, dedicated strategist) are sold but not yet implemented in Reviuzy or as Cloudflare Functions. Phases 2-4 close those gaps. Until shipped, agency delivery is manual or via partial substitutes; this is documented internally and will be reflected in onboarding scripts.

---

## Pickup checklist for next session

1. `git pull` to sync latest main (Phase 1 commit + HI commit `d9cca4b` + STATE.md commit `11f6b16` should all be present).
2. Run `node scripts/audit-translations-deep.mjs` — confirm 16/16 at 100%, placeholder counts in the 20-31 range across all secondaries.
3. Pick one of Phases 2/3/4 and follow the playbook: Reviuzy backend feature → admin panel → help center articles (EN+FR-CA minimum, then 14 secondaries) → Gov-grade security defaults (zod, rate-limit, audit log, RLS) → tests pass → manual deploy until GitHub Action lands.
4. If pushing for the first time after the GitHub Action workflow is committed: confirm `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret is set on the repo before push, or the workflow run will fail.
5. Always: `npm run build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=ailysagency --branch=main` for safe shipping until auto-deploy is back.
6. Verify in production after every deploy: hero, audit, services tier cards, pricing builder, /fr, /es, /zh, /ar, /ru.
